Transform your X4 empire from reactive management into intelligent operations.

## Current release

- Version: 3.2 GA

- Steam Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3778882957

## What is new in EOC 3.2 Build 253

- Adds bounded managed BUY actions for confirmed shortages and SELL actions for storage pressure.
- Adds Scout's long-term recommendations and ordered recovery playbooks across every supported issue family.
- Adds persistent two-way EOC/player command checklists with EOC-owned evidence, player decisions, and automatic verification.
- Preserves managed-action baselines so later stock movement can resolve, improve, or escalate a case.
- Makes Clear All reset cases, evidence, managed trade actions, checklist answers, and command requests before one fresh analysis.
- Isolates Docked-menu callbacks so one failing UI addon callback cannot suppress EOC access.
- Adds bounded Dock lifecycle diagnostics without a watcher, polling loop, or per-frame repair.
- Clarifies empire-analysis scope, storage evidence, and transient case-result ownership.
- Same-page buttons, forced verification, and automatic refreshes preserve the player's visible scroll position.
- Excludes Raw Scrap from conventional shortage cases, managed BUY actions, supplier/local-production advice, and EOC checklists because native X4 treats it as an infinite sink.
- Retires prior Raw Scrap EOC state through one bounded cleanup while preserving player-created investigations and continuing to monitor recycling stations and every other ware.
- Removes the obsolete EOC conversation pinwheel. Dock Interactions is now the authoritative access path, and closing EOC returns directly to normal play.

## Existing EOC capabilities

- Standalone EOC access from **Dock Interactions > OPEN EXECUTIVE OPERATIONS CENTER**.
- Persistent station roles and role-aware operational recommendations.
- Guided Recovery, evidence-backed cases, verification, bounded market tests, Managed Trade, shipping control, fleet templates, and reports.
- Mission-aware analysis, including intentional Terraforming-related activity.
- Player-controlled authority modes, deliberate amber confirmations, duplicate prevention, and no free ships or resource bypass.

## First-time access

1. Load the game and wait approximately 10 seconds for EOC initialization.
2. Open **Dock Interactions** from the top HUD menu.
3. Select **OPEN EXECUTIVE OPERATIONS CENTER**.
4. On first use, choose a name for the command intelligence.

## Installation

Copy `JK_Station_Manager` into the X4 `extensions` directory, or subscribe through Steam Workshop. Do not add another folder between `extensions` and `JK_Station_Manager`.

EOC is designed not to make a save dependent on the mod. It adds no permanent custom ships, stations, wares, sectors, or other assets required for the save to load. Players do not need to uninstall EOC before updating, and removing it later does not corrupt the save.
